# Game of Life Application

This repository contains two implementations of Conway's Game of Life:

1. **Basic Implementation**: A straightforward version of the Game of Life without optimizations, demonstrating the basic rules and visualization of the cellular automaton.
2. **Optimized Implementation**: An enhanced version of the Game of Life, featuring various optimizations for performance and visual improvements.

The basic implementation serves as an educational tool to understand the fundamental concepts of the Game of Life, while the optimized version showcases techniques to improve efficiency and aesthetics.
